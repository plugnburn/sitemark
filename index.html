Sitemark: Markdown single-pager library
=======================================

About the library
-----------------

Sitemark is a simple hosted or downloadable library that weighs almost nothing (minified version is under 4K) and allows you to publish your Markdown documents instantly as responsive, Bootstrap-based, themable, single-page websites. All your Markdown content is converted into HTML, and the second-level headings (or whatever you choose) turn into clickable menu entries. This website is built with Sitemark itself.

Just write your plain Markdown and adjust some visual parameters in the root element attributes, and Sitemark will take care of the rest.

Getting started
---------------

To get started with Sitemark, just copy and paste the following template into an HTML file:

```
<!DOCTYPE html>
<meta charset=utf-8><title>My cool Markdown-based single-pager</title>
<xmp data-theme=united data-menu-by=h2 data-menu-mode=default data-fav="icon.png">
My cool **Markdown content here**
</xmp>
<script src="http://plugnburn.github.io/sitemark/sitemark.min.js"></script>
```

That's pretty much it. But what do all these `data-` attributes mean? All of them are optional:

- `data-theme` specifies the theme name from [Bootswatch](http://bootswatch.com/), a great collection of free Bootstrap themes. If you don't specify this attribute, default Bootstrap design will be used.
- `data-menu-by` specifies the tag or selector by which menu entries will be built. Most likely you'll want to use your second level headings to serve as the base of your menu structure, so the most often used value will be `data-menu-by=h2`. Each heading element used in the menu gets its own ID: lowercased value of the heading text with spaces substituted for `-`, e.g. "My Cool Heading" turns into `my-cool-heading`. You can use this fact to simplify navigation within your page. If `data-menu-by` attribute is omitted, menu will not be built at all.
- `data-menu-mode` is the style for top navigation bar. Only two values are supported: `default` and `inverse`. If you omit the attribute, `default` will be used.
- `data-fav` can be used to specify the website favicon URL.

If you happen to use `<xmp>...</xmp>` tags **within** your document, you have to wrap the document into something else. In this case, you must specify `data-root` attribute for your root element. Example:

```
<!DOCTYPE html>
<meta charset=utf-8><title>Software documentation</title>
<pre data-root data-menu-by=h2 data-theme=paper>
...blah...
<xmp>
    var param = 5 //example code
</xmp>
...blah...
</pre>
<script src="http://plugnburn.github.io/sitemark/sitemark.min.js"></script>
```
_Note: if you have to substitute `<xmp>` tag for any other one, please test the rendering results carefully. Often `<textarea data-root>` tag will work fine._

FAQ
---

**How does Sitemark differ from [Strapdown](http://strapdownjs.com/) and other Markdown-to-page libraries?**

Although Sitemark creation was somewhat inspired by Strapdown, it serves an entirely different purpose. While Strapdown is best suited for documenting projects, it doesn't even allow your page to show your raw Markdown contents in the `xmp` element for someone with Javascript turned off, let alone menus, custom root tags or favicons. Sitemark, on the other hand, aims to minimize your efforts in converting large Markdown-formatted texts into valid and ready-to-publish single-page websites. In other words, the most important difference is: Strapdown is aimed on internal usage, Sitemark is aimed on external publishing. Other known Markdown-to-page libraries are mostly blog-oriented, which is not the niche Sitemark is going to cover.

**What Markdown version does Sitemark support?**

Sitemark supports [GitHub Flavored Markdown](https://help.github.com/articles/github-flavored-markdown/).

**What technologies is Sitemark built on?**

The answer is simple: written in CoffeeScript 1.9, uses GitHub Markdown API v3, Bootstrap with Bootswatch themes, and jQuery for mobile menu support (required by Bootstrap, loaded on-demand, no internal Sitemark parts use it). Minified version is compressed with [Google Closure Compiler](http://closure-compiler.appspot.com/home) in "advanced" mode.

**I see that you use unauthorized GitHub API requests. Are any problems with their rate limits likely to occur?**

Requests to GitHub API are issued **only when Markdown content changes**. Once the content is rendered, its rendered copy is saved into the browser's localStorage along with raw document checksum. API is called only if the live raw document checksum differs from the saved one on the next page load. However, if you use `<xmp>` tag, your document will look properly even in raw mode just in case you've run out of API calls.

**What old browsers does Sitemark support?**

Honestly, Sitemark has not been tested on any IE, should work on IE9+. Although you don't have to worry about that so much. If a browser isn't supported, raw preformatted Markdown will be displayed to the visitor. That's the entire point of good Markdown writing style: your pages will remain readable even on Lynx.
